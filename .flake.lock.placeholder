⚠️  IMPORTANT: This flake.lock is a placeholder

The actual flake.lock must be generated on a NixOS machine with:

    nix flake lock

This placeholder is committed to show the intent of having a locked flake,
but it will be regenerated with actual hashes when the PR is tested.

See TEST_PROTOCOL.md for the complete test procedure.
